Validation in default.stats:

- INFO Stats are currently ENABLED. Usage statistics are being

  collected. Thank you! These stats inform improvements to the product, and that

  helps the community. To disable, run `hal config stats disable`. To learn more

Validation in default.security:

- WARNING Your UI or API domain does not have override base URLs

  set even though your Spinnaker deployment is a Distributed deployment on a

  remote cloud provider. As a result, you will need to open SSH tunnels against

  that deployment to access Spinnaker.

? We recommend that you instead configure an authentication

  mechanism (OAuth2, SAML2, or x509) to make it easier to access Spinnaker

  securely, and then register the intended Domain and IP addresses that your

  publicly facing services will be using.
